Here are some use cases (abilities this calculator will need to have):

This calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math 
operators you typically find on calculators, including:

add
subtract
multiply
divide
A “clear” button

This calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a 
time. Example: 

you press a number button (12), followed by an operator button (+), a 
second number button (7), and finally a second operator button (-). 
This calculator should then do the following: first, evaluate the first pair of 
numbers (12 + 7), second, display the result of that calculation (19), and 
finally, use that result (19) as the first number in your new calculation, 
along with the next operator (-).
